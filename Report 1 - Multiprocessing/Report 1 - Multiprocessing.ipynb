    "As explored in Assignment 5, Multiprocessing offers a convenient means of parallelizing the execution of a function across multiple input values. This allows one to side-step the notorious Python global interpreter lock, by spawning subprocesses rather than threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest, and arguable most useful function of the multiprocessing package is the Pool object, which spawns multiple independent computations in parallel. This is ideal in cases where one is performing repetetive computations that are independent of one another, for example, performing a function on some large list of values. \n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance, it may seem that it doesn't make sense to spawn more processes than the number of CPUs that are available, however, in some cases, this may result in a speedup. To understand when this is possible, it is important to understand the difference between CPU-bound and I/O-bound tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This report will explore the main differences between such tasks, and thus provide some intuition on the optimal number of processes one should spawn when parallelizing in Python. "
