	title = {Superfluid and Insulating Phases in an Interacting-Boson Model: Mean-Field Theory and the {RPA}},
	journal = {EPL},
	abstract = {The bosonic Hubbard model is studied via a simple mean-field theory. At zero temperature, in addition to yielding a phase diagram that is qualitatively correct, namely a superfluid phase for non-integer fillings and a Mott transition from a superfluid to an insulating phase for integer fillings, this theory gives results that are in good agreement with Monte Carlo simulations. In particular, the superfluid fraction obtained as a function of the interaction strength U for both integer and non-integer fillings is close to the simulation results. In all phases the excitation spectra are obtained by using the random phase approximation (RPA): the spectrum has a gap in the insulating phase and is gapless (and linear at small wave vectors) in the superfluid phase. Analytic results are presented in the limits of large U and small superfluid density. Finite-temperature phase diagrams and the Mott-insulator-normal-phase crossover are also described.}

	abstract = {Symmetry plays a fundamental role in understanding complex quantum matter, particularly in classifying topological quantum phases, which have attracted great interests in the recent decade. An outstanding example is the time-reversal invariant topological insulator, a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase in the symplectic class of the Altland-Zirnbauer classification. We report the observation for ultracold atoms of a noninteracting SPT band in a one-dimensional optical lattice and study quench dynamics between topologically distinct regimes. The observed SPT band can be protected by a magnetic group and a nonlocal chiral symmetry, with the band topology being measured via Bloch states at symmetric momenta. The topology also resides in far-from-equilibrium spin dynamics, which are predicted and observed in experiment to exhibit qualitatively distinct behaviors in quenching to trivial and nontrivial regimes, revealing two fundamental types of spin-relaxation dynamics related to bulk topology. This work opens the way to expanding the scope of SPT physics with ultracold atoms and studying nonequilibrium quantum dynamics in these exotic systems.},

The properties of the metals nickel, palladium and platinum are discussed in the light of these results; platinum differs from nickel in that the orbital contribution to the moment of the elementary magnets is not quenched.

The boundary between the two regimes is found to depend both on disorder and on the strength of the interactions. The delocalized phase is dominated by superconducting fluctuations. We find the asymptotic behaviour of the localization length and the temperature dependence of the conductivity. An analogous description is developed for the localized-superfluid transition of a one-dimensional boson gas. In this case the transition to the localized regime occurs for increasingly repulsive interactions.}

@article{Koralek2009,
abstract = {According to Noether's theorem, for every symmetry in nature there is a corresponding conservation law. For example, invariance with respect to spatial translation corresponds to conservation of momentum. In another well-known example, invariance with respect to rotation of the electron's spin, or SU(2) symmetry, leads to conservation of spin polarization. For electrons in a solid, this symmetry is ordinarily broken by spin-orbit coupling, allowing spin angular momentum to flow to orbital angular momentum. However, it has recently been predicted that SU(2) can be achieved in a two-dimensional electron gas, despite the presence of spin-orbit coupling. The corresponding conserved quantities include the amplitude and phase of a helical spin density wave termed the 'persistent spin helix'. SU(2) is realized, in principle, when the strengths of two dominant spin-orbit interactions, the Rashba (strength parameterized by alpha) and linear Dresselhaus (beta(1)) interactions, are equal. This symmetry is predicted to be robust against all forms of spin-independent scattering, including electron-electron interactions, but is broken by the cubic Dresselhaus term (beta(3)) and spin-dependent scattering. When these terms are negligible, the distance over which spin information can propagate is predicted to diverge as alpha approaches beta(1). Here we report experimental observation of the emergence of the persistent spin helix in GaAs quantum wells by independently tuning alpha and beta(1). Using transient spin-grating spectroscopy, we find a spin-lifetime enhancement of two orders of magnitude near the symmetry point. Excellent quantitative agreement with theory across a wide range of sample parameters allows us to obtain an absolute measure of all relevant spin-orbit terms, identifying beta(3) as the main SU(2)-violating term in our samples. The tunable suppression of spin relaxation demonstrated in this work is well suited for application to spintronics.},

These microscopic quantum fluctuations can induce a macroscopic phase transition in the ground state of a many-body system when the relative strength of two competing energy terms is varied across a critical value. Here we observe such a quantum phase transition in a Bose–Einstein condensate with repulsive interactions, held in a three-dimensional optical lattice potential. As the potential depth of the lattice is increased, a transition is observed from a superfluid to a Mott insulator phase. In the superfluid phase, each atom is spread out over the entire lattice, with long-range phase coherence. But in the insulating phase, exact numbers of atoms are localized at individual lattice sites, with no phase coherence across the lattice; this phase is characterized by a gap in the excitation spectrum. We can induce reversible changes between the two ground states of the system.},

abstract = {Spin-orbit (SO) coupling-the interaction between a quantum particle's spin and its momentum-is ubiquitous in physical systems. In condensed matter systems, SO coupling is crucial for the spin-Hall effect(1,2) and topological insulators(3-5); it contributes to the electronic properties of materials such as GaAs, and is important for spintronic devices(6). Quantum many-body systems of ultracold atoms can be precisely controlled experimentally, and would therefore seem to provide an ideal platform on which to study SO coupling. Although an atom's intrinsic SO coupling affects its electronic structure, it does not lead to coupling between the spin and the centre-of-mass motion of the atom. Here, we engineer SO coupling (with equal Rashba(7) and Dresselhaus(8) strengths) in a neutral atomic Bose-Einstein condensate by dressing two atomic spin states with a pair of lasers(9). Such coupling has not been realized previously for ultracold atomic gases, or indeed any bosonic system. Furthermore, in the presence of the laser coupling, the interactions between the two dressed atomic spin states are modified, driving a quantum phase transition from a spatially spin-mixed state (lasers off) to a phase-separated state (above a critical laser intensity). We develop a many-body theory that provides quantitative agreement with the observed location of the transition. The engineered SO coupling-equally applicable for bosons and fermions-sets the stage for the realization of topological insulators in fermionic neutral atom systems.},

Bosons in periodic potentials (e.g., on a lattice) at T=0 exhibit two types of phases: a superfluid phase and Mott insulating phases characterized by integer (or commensurate) boson densities, by the existence of a gap for particle-hole excitations, and by zero compressibility. Generically, the superfluid onset transition in d dimensions from a Mott insulator to superfluidity is ‘‘ideal,'' or mean field in character, but at special multicritical points with particle-hole symmetry it is in the universality class of the (d+1)-dimensional XY model. In the presence of disorder, a third, ‘‘Bose glass'' phase exists.

abstract = {The competition between interactions acting on different length scales lies at the core of a variety of processes leading to structure formation in nature. Examples range from the folding mechanisms of proteins to the appearance of stripe phases in quantum matter. Theoretical characterization of such emerging structures is often exceedingly challenging even if simple toy models are used. A complementary approach to gain insights into complex phenomena has been advanced for quantum matter, where simulation experiments with ultracold atoms are carried out. However these experiments are mostly limited to short-range collisional interactions. Recently observed perturbative effects of long-range interactions were too weak to reach novel quantum phases. Here we experimentally realize a bosonic lattice model with competing short- and infinite-range interactions, and observe the appearance of four distinct phases - a superfluid, a supersolid, a Mott insulator and a charge density wave. Our system is based on an atomic quantum gas trapped in an optical lattice inside a high finesse optical cavity. The strength of the short-ranged on-site interactions is controlled by means of the optical lattice depth. The infinite-range interaction potential is mediated by a vacuum mode of the cavity and is independently controlled by tuning the cavity resonance. When probing the phase transition between the Mott insulator and the charge density wave in real-time, we discovered a behaviour characteristic of a first order phase transition. Our measurements have accessed a regime for quantum simulation of many-body systems, where the physics is determined by the intricate competition between two different types of interactions and the zero point motion of the particles.},

@article{Batrouni2006,
abstract = {We present results of quantum Monte Carlo simulations for the soft-core extended bosonic Hubbard model in one dimension exhibiting the presence of supersolid phases similar to those recently found in two dimensions. We find that in one and two dimensions, the insulator-supersolid transition has dynamic critical exponent z = 2 whereas the first order insulator-superfluid transition in two dimensions is replaced by a continuous transition with z = 1 in one dimension. We present evidence that this transition is in the Kosterlitz-Thouless universality class and discuss the mechanism behind this difference. The simultaneous presence of two types of quasi-long-range order results in two solitonlike dips in the excitation spectrum.},

@article{Hsieh2008,
abstract = {When electrons are subject to a large external magnetic field, the conventional charge quantum Hall effect $\backslash$cite{\{}Klitzing,Tsui{\}} dictates that an electronic excitation gap is generated in the sample bulk, but metallic conduction is permitted at the boundary. Recent theoretical models suggest that certain bulk insulators with large spin-orbit interactions may also naturally support conducting topological boundary states in the extreme quantum limit, which opens up the possibility for studying unusual quantum Hall-like phenomena in zero external magnetic fields. Bulk Bi{\{}1-x{\}}Sbx single crystals are predicted to be prime candidates for one such unusual Hall phase of matter known as the topological insulator. The hallmark of a topological insulator is the existence of metallic spin-textured surface states that are higher dimensional analogues of the edge states that characterize a quantum spin Hall insulator. Here, using incident-photon-energy-modulated angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we report the direct observation of massive Dirac particles in the bulk of Bi0.9Sb0.1, locate the Kramers' points at the sample's boundary and provide a comprehensive mapping of the topological Dirac insulator's gapless surface modes. These findings taken together suggest that the observed surface state on the boundary of the bulk insulator is a realization of the much sought exotic "topological metal". They also suggest that this material has potential application in developing next-generation quantum computing devices that may incorporate "light-like" bulk carriers and topologically protected spin-textured edge-surface currents.

@article{Kim2004,
abstract = {When liquid (4)He is cooled below 2.176 K, it undergoes a phase transition-Bose-Einstein condensation-and becomes a superfluid with zero viscosity. Once in such a state, it can flow without dissipation even through pores of atomic dimensions. Although it is intuitive to associate superflow only with the liquid phase, it has been proposed theoretically that superflow can also occur in the solid phase of (4)He. Owing to quantum mechanical fluctuations, delocalized vacancies and defects are expected to be present in crystalline solid (4)He, even in the limit of zero temperature. These zero-point vacancies can in principle allow the appearance of superfluidity in the solid. However, in spite of many attempts, such a 'supersolid' phase has yet to be observed in bulk solid (4)He. Here we report torsional oscillator measurements on solid helium confined in a porous medium, a configuration that is likely to be more heavily populated with vacancies than bulk helium. We find an abrupt drop in the rotational inertia of the confined solid below a certain critical temperature. The most likely interpretation of the inertia drop is entry into the supersolid phase. If confirmed, our results show that all three states of matter-gas, liquid and solid-can undergo Bose-Einstein condensation.},
