\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

    Over the past two-decades, the increasing computational power available
to researchers has lead to significant advances in the area of quantum
many-body physics. Numerical methods continue to play an increasingly
prominent role in this field. Despite these advances, simulating
many-body systems remains a difficult task, as the underlying Hilbert
space scales exponentially with the number of particles. To get around
this, various analytical and numerical techniques have been explored to
approximate solutions of these types of problems.

Recently, there has been immense experimental advances in the trapping
of ultracold atoms in optical lattices (atomic lattices constructed by
interfering lasers), which has renewed interest in lattice models of
neutral bosonic atoms. Such environments serve as ideal playgrounds to
study the dynamics of quantum many-body systems, as experimentalists
have precise control of the underlying lattice potential, and the
properties of ultracold atoms can be widely tuned with external fields.
In particular, the versatility of optical lattice environments has lead
to the realization of a wide range of quantum phase transitions, which
refers to phase transitions that occur only at low temperatures, where
thermal fluctuations are strongly suppressed.

The canonical example of such a model is the Bose-Hubbard model, which
describes an approximate Hamiltonian for atoms in an optical lattice,
and consists of bosons hopping between discrete lattice sites, and
interacting at close range. It has been shown that in such a model, the
competing lattice tunnelling and interaction terms drive a quantum phase
transition between superfluid and insulating phases. Since then, the
Bose-Hubbard model has been realized experimentally, and extensions to
the model have been of great interest from both the experiment and
theory point of view.

The main difficulty that arises in the theoretical study of the
Bose-Hubbard model is that the Hamiltonian cannot be diagonalized
analytically whenever interactions are present. Additionally, numerical
studies are restricted by the exponential scaling of the lattice. The
latter problem role is generally supressed by a studying the model
within a mean-field theory, where long range correlations are
approximated to first order by replacing some operators by their average
values.

This notebook presents the explorations of various computational methods
that can be used to study the Bose-Hubbard model in the context of a
zero-temperature mean-field theory. In particular, we will explore the
method of exact diagonalization, variational methods, as well as
imaginary-time propagation to compute ground states in the Bose-Hubbard
model for various parameters. The benchmarks used to compare each method
will be ability of the method to produce a mean-field phase diagram that
is consistent with current literature, as well as the time required to
perform such a task.

\subsubsection{Bosons}\label{bosons}}

    There are many systems in nature that are comprised of several identical
particles. Such particles all share the same intrinsic properties, such
as charge, mass and spin, and therefore cannot be distinguished by
measuring their underlying characteristics. In classical mechanics,
these particles can be readily distinguished by following their
individual trajectories through phase space. In quantum mechanics
however, such a trajectory is ill-defined due to the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle.

This principle of indistinguishibility turns out to be quite
fundamental, as it implies that many identical quantum particles obey
either Fermi or Bose statistics. Particles that obey the former are
known as \emph{fermions}, and they are characterized by obeying the
Pauli exclusion principle, which states that no two particles can occupy
the same quantum state. In contrast, particles that obey Bose statistics
are known as \emph{bosons}, and an arbitrary number of them can occupy
the same state. In this work, we will consider only bosonic particles,
which is motivated by the fact that the aforementioned optical lattice
experiments are often performed with neutral bosonic atoms, most notably
with \(^{87}\text{Rb}\), which was used to create the first
Bose-Einstein condensate in 1995.

Since the particles are indistinguishable, we don't care about which
particle is where, but rather just how many bosons are occupying each
available quantum state. In our case, these so called states will
correspond to a particles position on a 1D lattice. A convenient choice
of an orthonormal basis for representing a many-body bosonic
wavefunction is therefore the \emph{occupation number basis}, where the
basis vectors look like

\[| n_0 ,n_1,n_2,\ldots \rangle\]

which corresponds to the state with \(n_0\) bosons occupying the
\(0^\text{th}\) lattice site, \(n_1\) bosons occupying the
\(1^\text{st}\) lattice site, and so on. Any arbitrary many-body
wavefunction can then be written as a superposition of vectors in the
occupation number basis.

We would now like to be able to describe operators in this
representation. To each lattice site, we associate a pair of operators
\(\hat a_j^\dagger\) and \(\hat a_j\), known as creation and
annihilation operators, which obey the commutator relations

\[[ \hat a_j ;  \hat a_k] = 0  \qquad [ \hat a_j, \hat a_k^\dagger] = \delta_{jk}\]

In particular, the action of these operators on an occupation number
basis state is given by

\begin{align}
\hat a_j | n_0,n_1, \ldots,n_j ,\ldots \rangle &= \sqrt{n_j} | n_0,n_1, \ldots,n_j-1 ,\ldots \rangle \\
\hat a_j^\dagger | n_0,n_1, \ldots,n_j ,\ldots \rangle &= \sqrt{n_j+1} | n_0,n_1, \ldots,n_j +1,\ldots \rangle .
\end{align}

That is, the action of a creation (annihilation) operator is to quite
literally create (annihilate) a boson that is occupying the
\(j^\text{th}\) state. It is also convenient to define a number operator

\[ \hat n_j  =  \hat a_j^\dagger \hat a_j \]

where the action of the number operator is to count the number of bosons
occupying the \(j^\text{th}\) lattice site, i.e.

\[\hat n_j | n_0,n_1, \ldots,n_j ,\ldots \rangle = n_j  | n_0,n_1, \ldots,n_j ,\ldots \rangle .\]
